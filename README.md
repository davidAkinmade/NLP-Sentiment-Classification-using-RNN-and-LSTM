# NLP-Sentiment-Classification-using-RNN-and-LSTM
A Sentiment classification project that implements and compares the performance of RNN and LSTM neural networks on Amazon Food Reviews data
With the ever reducing costs and assured investment return on online commerce, more businesses are shifting their entire operations to the internet. Key to ensuring that businesses do not fall behind in terms of maintaining their quality of service is the ability to respond quickly to the problems faced by customers, which is usually reflected in the reviews they leave behind after every transaction. This report therefore approaches the problem of text classification by making use of NLP techniques and Neural Networks (RNN and LSTM) to extract the respective overall sentiment from each row of Amazon Fine Food Review text data. The results from each model is presented and compared against each other and a baseline Logistic Regression model
